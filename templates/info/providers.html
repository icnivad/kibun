	<h1>What is MoodToolkit?</h1>
	<br/>
	MoodToolkit is a website designed to help people with anxiety and depression.  
	When you are feeling bad, it can be hard to motivate yourself to do anything, even activities like exercise that might make you feel better.  
	<br/>
	MoodToolkit helps you keep track of the different activities you do and how they affect your mood.  Then you can find out which activities are most helpful in making you feel better.  

	<h1>How does MoodToolkit work?</h1>
	Have your patient <a href="/accounts/register">sign up</a>.  You can do this together, or you can have them do this on their own.  
	<br/>
	Next, work with your patient to choose several activities which might help them cope with anxiety or depression.  Once they are logged in, they can <a href="/activity/edit/">add these activities</a>.
	Next time your patient wants to do an activity and is wondering whether this activity will help their mood, they can follow these steps:  
	<br/><a href="/activity">Choose an activity</a>.  Use the website to record how they feel before the activity, then record how they feel after the activity.
	<a href="/accounts/login">Log in</a> or <a href="/accounts/register">Sign up</a> to save their data.
	<br/><br/>
	Over time, MoodToolkit will keep track of which activities result in the biggest boost in your patient's mood.  

	You can check out a <a href="/activity/summary">summary</a> of how different activities affect you at MoodToolkit Summary.  If you want, you can share this summary with your therapist or physician to help them give you better care.
